# METAPIPE_METAbarcoding_PIPEline
METAPIPE was designed to make the bioinformatics needed to analyze metabarcoding data as accessible as possible, especially for beginners. The chain of commands from several softwares were wrapped in six bash scripts with a help argument (-h) explaining how to load the input files, and set options for each step.

The scripts and jobs were configured to run on PBS and SLURM, and the respective system is indicated in the filenames.
